  My name is Mackenzie Locey and I am a senior in Community in Regional Planning with minors in Business and GIS. I grew up in Bettendorf, IA - one of the four Quad Cities. I am a Co-President for the ISU Winter Guard Club and I work as a secretary in the Ag&Biosystems Engineering Advising Office in Elings hall. I am also an intern in the Planning and Zoning department for the City of Nevada.
